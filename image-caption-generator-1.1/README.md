# Image Caption Generator
This project uses a combination of CNN and RNN to generate caption for images.
The "merge-model" was used. This model is described by Marc Tanti, et al. in their papers:
* [Where to put the Image in an Image Caption Generator](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09137)
* [What is the Role of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in an Image Caption Generator?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02043)
